### Port Already in Use

1. Kill the process using the port:
   ```bash
   # On Mac/Linux
   lsof -i :8084  # Find the process ID (PID)
   kill <PID>     # Kill the process
   ```

   ```bash
   PORT=8085 python app.py
   ```

## Example Usage

Here are some ways to test and use TasteBud:

### 1. Finding Recipes with Available Ingredients
Let's say you have these ingredients in your kitchen:
- Chicken
- Rice
- Garlic
- Onion

Simply type these ingredients into the search bar (one at a time) and click "Add". TasteBud will show you recipes that match your ingredients, sorted by how well they match. You might discover recipes like "Chicken Fried Rice" or "Garlic Chicken with Rice".

### 2. Saving Your Favorite Recipes
Found a recipe you love? Here's how to save it:
1. Click on any recipe to view its details
2. Click the heart icon (ü§ç) to save it
3. Access your saved recipes anytime by clicking "Saved Recipes" in the navigation bar
4. To remove a recipe from your favorites, click the heart icon again (‚ù§Ô∏è)

### 3. Finding Ingredient Substitutions
Out of an ingredient? TasteBud can help:
1. Open any recipe
2. Click on any ingredient in the list
3. Click "Find Substitute"
4. You'll see alternative ingredients you can use instead

For example:
- No eggs? Try mashed banana or applesauce
- Out of butter? Use olive oil or coconut oil
- No milk? Almond milk or soy milk work great

### 4. Recipe Search Examples
Try these search combinations:
- For breakfast: "eggs, bread, butter"
- For a quick dinner: "pasta, tomatoes, garlic"
- For dessert: "flour, sugar, vanilla"
- For vegetarian options: "tofu, rice, vegetables"

### 5. Using the Step-by-Step Instructions
When viewing a recipe:
1. Start with the ingredient list to ensure you have everything
2. Click "Start Cooking" to begin
3. Use the arrow keys or swipe to navigate between steps
4. Each step is timed to help you stay on track

### Tips
